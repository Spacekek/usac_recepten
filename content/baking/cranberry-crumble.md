## Ingredients

* 500 gr cranberries (freezed)
* 250 gr blackberries (freezed)
* 1,5 tbsp cornstarch
* 2 tbsp sugar
* 1 pouch vanilla sugar
* 100 gr hazelnuts
* 100 gr margarine (cold)
* 50 gr sugar
* 200 gr flour
  Optionally:
* Vanilla ice cream (vegan is available (e.g. hertog)
* 250 ml whipped cream (vegan is available e.g. blue band (watch out for soy if you need it to be soy free))
* ~30 gr chocolate (dark for vegan)
* Making this with cherries instead of cranberries is also delicious!

Budgetary consideration:
Removing the ice cream makes this cheaper!

## Steps

1. Put the cranberries and blackberries in an ovenproof dish. Add the cornstarch and 1 tablespoon of sugar. Roughly chop the hazelnuts and add them to the fruit. Mix everything well.
2. Meanwhile make the crumble. Put the sugar and flour in a bowl and add the cold butter. Pinch and rub the butter into the dry ingredients with your fingers until coarse crumbs form. Spread these crumbs over the fruit.
3. Bake for about 30 minutes at 180°C.
4. Serve the cherry crumble with vanilla ice cream and optionally whipped cream.
